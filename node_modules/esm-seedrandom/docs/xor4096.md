### `prng_xor4096`

xor4096, by Richard Brent, is a 4096-bit xor-shift with a
very long period that also adds a Weyl generator. It also passes
BigCrush with no systematic failures.  Its long period may
be useful if you have many generators and need to avoid
collisions.

- **Period:** 2^4128-2^32.
- **Reported to pass:** No systematic BigCrush failures reported.
